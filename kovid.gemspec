    ============================================================================
      COVID-19 has devasted the world. But while we're fighting
      with the novel coronavirus, I think stats on the issue should be
      accessible.

      There isn't much we can do now aside:

      * Washing our hands with soap frequently.
      * Limiting our movements, how much we touch our faces & social distancing.
      * Disinfecting our phones, keys, doorknobs, keyboards, etc.
      * Being there for each other.

      Stay safe!
      Emmanuel Hayford.
