# ü¶† Kovid

Kovid is a small CLI app to fetch data surrounding the coronavirus pandemic of 2019. I found myself checking [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic) constantly for information so I thought I'd build this to provide info directly in the terminal. It's where some of us spend time more.

Code contribution and ideas welcome.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

To install:

* Ô∏è Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.

*  Run `gem install kovid`.

It's recommended you update often with `gem update kovid`.

## ‚öíÔ∏è Usage

You can run `kovid --help` to see the full list of available commands.

#### Commands Overview
üò∑ **Fetching**
* `kovid check COUNTRY` OR `kovid country COUNTRY`.
* `kovid check COUNTRY -f` OR `kovid check COUNTRY --full`.

üá™üá∫üá™üá∫üá™üá∫

You can fetch aggregated EU (all 27 countries combined) data:
* `kovid eu`.

üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏

You can fetch US state-specific data:
* `kovid state STATE` OR `kovid state "STATE NAME"`.

üò∑ **Comparing**
* `kovid compare FOO BAR` (sorts by cases DESC).
* `kovid compare FOO BAR -f` OR `kovid compare FOO BAR --full` (sorts by cases DESC).

Where `FOO` and `BAR` are different countries.

You can compare as many countries as you want; `kovid compare FOO BAR BAZ` OR `kovid compare FOO BAR BAZ -f`

üò∑ **History**
* `kovid history COUNTRY` (full history).
* `kovid history COUNTRY N` (history in the last N days).

üò∑ **Total figures**
* `kovid cases` (summary of reported incidents globally).

**NOTE:** If you find it irritating to have to type `kovid state STATE`, `covid state STATE` works as well.
