# ü¶† Kovid

Kovid is a small CLI app to fetch data surrounding the coronavirus pandemic of 2019. I found myself checking [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic) constantly for information and since I work mostly in the terminal, like most of you, I thought I'd build this to put the data right at our fingertips.



Please feel free to contribute or suggest ideas!
