# ü¶† Kovid

Kovid is a small CLI app to fetch data surrounding the coronavirus pandemic of 2019. I found myself checking [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic) constantly for information so I thought I'd build this to provide info directly in the terminal. It's where some of us spend time more.

Code contribution and ideas welcome.

* Ô∏è Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.
